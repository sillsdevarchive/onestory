Can't seem to "Remove" a cultural note

Make the testing question a different color

If I open a project with only English and then a project with all three languages, it doesn't show the other two in the view menu?!

Loading a new project doesn't seem to update the window frame (perhaps in a project which has no stories)

Remove double spaces within sentences as well.

When you add a view (e.g. adding the Hindi when it's not normally shown), it would be nice to go back to where you were.

if PF tries to type in Hindi while still in PF types Story language), then encourage them to "Next State" (for all the initial states)

Changing the name of a story in the Panorama view, doesn't change the combo box *Text* field (but it does update the combo box). Does this or anything affect the "Time in state" (seems to be shorter than it should)
