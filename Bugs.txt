The drag-drop seems to be missing the hidden verses

Up down buttons don't work in the Panorama window (moved a story from Old Stroies and tried to position it)

When drag-drop verse (either direction?) it isn't inserting into the right position

when scrolling down and the 5 minute timeout expires (and save is done), then don't refresh to the earlier box that had the cursor (find out which one is visible and jump to that

Don't enter a transition record until the state *has* changed.

try Historical Differences with "Show All"

make it so that if we're only viewing open conversations, then have a button next to Add Note to 'Show All' (so we can temporarily override the viewing open conversations setting.

Gray out the "Edit Key Terms" menu if it isn't going to launch it

add 'hidden text' to the search dialog (don't search 'hidden' verses unless it's checked, and NavigateTo needs to unhide such a find)

can we allow the retelling/answers/connotes be in some other lg?

Add search to Bible pane as well

From the Story Information dialog, add 'View member info' button

Adjust the Instructions to fit a smaller screen better

Ask which UNS at the beginning rather than at hte end (if you're adding UNS #2 answers and you do 'Add New test results" before the question is asked, it'll think somethign else..dummty.

Test whether two versions of the OSE can be run at the same time without problems. (at the very least, make sure it doesn't do sync and try to open the same project file, which it will by default).
