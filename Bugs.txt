don't do end-sync when doing Advanced, Program Updates, check now

if a new language is added in NewProject dialog, compare against the default tasks and ask if they want to set.

disable the add inference testing question boxes from 'Edit' menu when no story is current

disable the coach pane from StateTransitions.xml SetView

while in 'add story question' state, on the EnableFieldsForm some fields are disabled

धन्य with and without ZWJ?

add count of TQs to the panorama view

check for answer boxes is not working

automatically send emails when "Send to xxx" happens

Check on removing ScrollIntoView (see what it feels like). Problem with overage on the screen jumping around too much.

Resolving project notes doesn't seem to make them go away.

Do check for program update in a background thread so it doesn't launch so slowly.

Do a check to see if the same project is opened in two instances of the program.

Put http base address of repo in project file so that if the user accidentally does reset stored information, they won't lose the fact that there was an Internet repos (i.e. Send/Receive stops working).

Check out:
C:\src\WW\Lib\src\EC\AIGuesserEC\AdaptItKBReader.cs and DLLs
C:\src\WW\Lib\src\EC\AIGuesserEC\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs

Bob, would it be nice to have a different tab for the non-biblical stories, so that they wouldn't mix up with the panorma? Just like the 'old stories' section, but then a different one for non-bibs?

Check out searching on L&C Notes.

In Tbx, you could right-click to "Jump" to an L&C note... what could that mean in OSE?

do Hindi->English AIKB

fix the select multiple languages from retell, answers, etc, to 'add note on selected text'

change ln # references in ConNotes if lines are added/deleted.

Make it possible to have multiple roles (i.e. use a bit field and check boxes rather than radio buttons)

in local glossing, if there is no change between src & target, then display near source the "similar" words for them to choose from. Then all changes to the source line (which might need to be fed back to the source line in the editor).

Add right-click on anchor button to all "NO ANCHOR" as a legitimate anchor.

Where would general testing questions go?

Have an option to do an orthogonal "task" rather than only state machine so that the PF can do anything they want when they want, with perhaps the only restriction being "have 1/2 TQs" check before going to the consultant.

simplify the case of adding TQs immediately followed by answers.

Add Story numbering

Add to AdaptItEncConverter the ability to return words from the KB that are "similar" (ala Mark Penny's normalization algorithm). The provide those as right-click options to the glossing.

disable auto-save timeout when *any* messageBox is up.

Can I add spelling check?

in settings dialog, if a tab is clicked, then do 'Next'

DChartHelper: fix the repaint and add 'export all' feature

Fix AdaptIt EncConverter to not allow zero lenght words/phrases and RS fields

Fix Toolbox export to make a separate typ for coach notes (so we can have different 'next' fields for the two different filetypes)

When inserting records, use 'a', 'b', etc, so we don't change the line numbers

selectively show different tests

add 'hidden text' to the search dialog (don't search 'hidden' verses unless it's checked, and NavigateTo needs to unhide such a find)

can we allow the retelling/answers/connotes be in some other lg?

Add search to Bible pane as well

Make the testing question a different color

When you add a view (e.g. adding the Hindi when it's not normally shown), it would be nice to go back to where you were.

When logged in as "Just Browsing", then disable Modified so we don't offer to save just by setting the logged in member.

Ask which UNS at the beginning rather than at hte end (if you're adding UNS #2 answers and you do 'Add New test results" before the question is asked, it'll think somethign else..dummty.

Test whether two versions of the OSE can be run at the same time without problems. (at the very least, make sure it doesn't do sync and try to open the same project file, which it will by default).
