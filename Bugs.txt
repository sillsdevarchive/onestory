DChartHelper: fix the repaint and add 'export all' feature

Fix AdaptIt EncConverter to not allow zero lenght words/phrases and RS fields

Fix Toolbox export to make a separate typ for coach notes (so we can have different 'next' fields for the two different filetypes)

When inserting records, use 'a', 'b', etc, so we don't change the line numbers

selectively show different tests

Gray out the "Edit Key Terms" menu if it isn't going to launch it

add 'hidden text' to the search dialog (don't search 'hidden' verses unless it's checked, and NavigateTo needs to unhide such a find)

can we allow the retelling/answers/connotes be in some other lg?

Add search to Bible pane as well
