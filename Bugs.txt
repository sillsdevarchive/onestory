it seems that with Hindi as Vern and only English BT, the PF wasn't asked for the UNS Backtranslator
same situation, but entering new testing question seems to not show English (but only on Karan's machine)
removing an empty testing question boxes doesn't seem to work

the radio buttons on Edit Member Info dialog are not in tab order.

deleted one story, and renamed another story with the name of the first story (in Panorama view) and it seemed to show the deleted one until I rebooted

Having a search string and deleteing a portion of it will save each instance of it (less one character) in the recent list...

If I have split lines of vern and 1 line of two sentences of Hindi and I say "Next State", it'll split it, but then fail to transition because of the empty BT space... But it'll still ahve duplicated the split line, but not shown it.

Can't seem to "Remove" a cultural note

Make the testing question a different color

If I open a project with only English and then a project with all three languages, it doesn't show the other two in the view menu?!

Loading a new project doesn't seem to update the window frame (perhaps in a project which has no stories)

Remove double spaces within sentences as well.

When you add a view (e.g. adding the Hindi when it's not normally shown), it would be nice to go back to where you were.

Add the ability to copy a story to a new name.

if PF tries to type in Hindi while still in PF types Story language), then encourage them to "Next State" (for all the initial states)

Changing the name of a story in the Panorama view, doesn't change the combo box *Text* field (but it does update the combo box). Does this or anything affect the "Time in state" (seems to be shorter than it should)
