no horizontal scroll bar in ConNotes

make sure 'use for all stories' works from startup

make sure about testing questions before going into "do uns test" state

make sure the 'transition' text is updated in the Select State dialog

allow consult & coach to make edits to the ConNotes panes even when the story is in a PF state

add ability to have one-sided conversations in the ConNote panes (Add Place Holders button? or Add Bookmark?) or "Add note to self"

DChartHelper: fix the repaint and add 'export all' feature

Fix AdaptIt EncConverter to not allow zero lenght words/phrases and RS fields

Fix Toolbox export to make a separate typ for coach notes (so we can have different 'next' fields for the two different filetypes)

When inserting records, use 'a', 'b', etc, so we don't change the line numbers

selectively show different tests

add 'hidden text' to the search dialog (don't search 'hidden' verses unless it's checked, and NavigateTo needs to unhide such a find)

can we allow the retelling/answers/connotes be in some other lg?

Add search to Bible pane as well

Test whether two versions of the OSE can be run at the same time without problems. (at the very least, make sure it doesn't do sync and try to open the same project file, which it will by default).
