Find doesn't work for new HTML controls

add 'hidden text' to the search dialog (don't search 'hidden' verses unless it's checked, and NavigateTo needs to unhide such a find)

can we allow the retelling/answers/connotes be in some other lg?

Add search to Bible pane as well

Same with other kinds of "InitAllPanes" work (e.g. Deleting a verse, etc), adding panes, changing views... remember which control had the focus and make sure that control (in each pane) still has focus).

From the Story Information dialog, add 'View member info' button

Don't continue to nag about no purpose/resources used for CITs

add steps after the first CIT to go back to the PF for the back-and-forth

make the font for consultant notes modifiable

Line 0 for each story for global con-notes

Coach notes state isn't getting initials (when you right-click and choose "Add Note" on the ConNOte pane

 clicking 'Crafter' button in Story Information dialog should update the title of the dialog.

Round number should be 1 until after the online review...

Ask which UNS at the beginning rather than at hte end (if you're adding UNS #2 answers and you do 'Add New test results" before the question is asked, it'll think somethign else..dummty.

When viewing "Old Stories", don't do Internet sync

Resize on Biblical Terms dialog isn't working

Ask Karan what his role is going to be on the Kinnauri project (does he need to do their English BTs?)

Test whether two versions of the OSE can be run at the same time without problems. (at the very least, make sure it doesn't do sync and try to open the same project file, which it will by default).
