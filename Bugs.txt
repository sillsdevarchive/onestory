Can't seem to "Remove" a cultural note

Make the testing question a different color

When you add a view (e.g. adding the Hindi when it's not normally shown), it would be nice to go back to where you were.

Changing the name of a story in the Panorama view, doesn't change the combo box *Text* field (but it does update the combo box). Does this or anything affect the "Time in state" (seems to be shorter than it should)
