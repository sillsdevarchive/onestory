    <StageInstructions>
By this stage, you will have already crafted and recorded a story according to the procedure you 
learned in the workshop. See the document "Steps in the Story Crafting Process.doc" for details.

Now you should listen line-by-line to the recording and type it in the verse fields in this window.

You can type the entire story into a single verse box. Then when you're finished, click on the 
"Next State" button in the lower left corner of the screen and the program will split the story 
into sentences so that each verse line has a single sentence in it.

If this is a story from the Bible, then you will also be asked to type in the purpose that this 
story is in the set; that is, why have you chosen this particular story? How does it fit with the 
theme of your panorama? You will also enter the list of resources used in crafting the story 
(audio recordings of Bibles, videos, etc).

    <StageInstructions>
In this stage, you need to find an uninitiated native speaker (UNS) to listen to the story and 
have him or her "back-translate" the story into the national language (e.g. Hindi). Then you 
will type the back-translation line-by-line into the verse field(s) in this window.

Be sure to type the UNS's back-translation into the same line number as the story verse to the 
left, so that the back-translation matches what's in the story verse.

When you are finished entering the national language back-translation, then click the button 
in the left-hand side of the status bar with the label 'Next State' to go to the next stage.

You will also be asked to identify which UNS did the back-translation, and if it is a story 
from the Bible, you will be asked for other information, such as the purpose of the story and 
the list of resources used in crafting it. You can also access this information by clicking, 
"Story", and then "Story Information".

    <StageInstructions>
In this stage, one of the crafting team will translate the National language back translation of the
story into English (or from the story language if not using the national language back-translation).

Unlike the last stage, where the National Language back translation had to done by a UNS, in this
state, anyone can do the English back translation. However, if you have an "English Back-translator"
on your team, then you must be logged in as the 'English back-translator' to add this new back-
translation. You can click, 'Project', 'Settings', and click the 'Add New Member' button to add
an "English back-translator".

There's a program called 'Adapt It' that can be used to help make the English back-translation more
efficiently. Click on the 'Story' menu, 'Do English Glossing in Adapt It' menu, and then click the
"From (National language)" command. This will write the national language back-translation of the
story into an Adapt It file so you can use that program to do the translation.

[note: there's another command on the 'Do English Glossing in Adapt It' menu: "From (Story) language
(for Discourse Charting)". This command is useful if you want to create the English back-translation
directly from your story language (e.g. Kangri) rather than the national language (e.g. Hindi). You
might do this primarily if you want to create a discourse chart in the story language itself and have
English glosses. However, this cannot be used to populate the English back-translation fields in this
program. This is because the English back-translation is supposed to be based on the Hindi back-
translation rather than the original story language. Discuss this with your advisor/consultant to know
which one you should use.

When you are finished entering the English back translation, then click the button in the left-hand
side of the status bar with the label 'Next State' to go to the next stage in the process.

    <StageDisplayString>Crafter adds biblical anchors</StageDisplayString>
    <StageInstructions>
In this stage, one of the crafting team will go through the story verse-by-verse and look up one or more Bible references 
in the Bible pane that supports the information in the verse. These Bible references are known as "Anchors", because they 
tie the story verse to the Bible.

For example, if your story verse were, "First of all, God made heaven and earth", then you could use the reference 
"Gen 1:1" as the anchor, which in the Net Bible says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth". You could 
also include another anchor like Col 1:16, which says, "for all things in heaven and on earth were created by him..."
Both of these passages support the idea that "First of all, God made heaven and earth"

When you find a supporting Bible passage, then click and hold down the left mouse button on the button to the left of the 
Bible passage in the Bible pane. Then while the left mouse button is held down, drag the mouse onto the line in the story 
verse area above with the label, "anc:". This is the anchor bar for the verse. When the mouse is over the anchor bar, 
release the left mouse button and a new "anchor button" will appear on the anchor bar for that passage.

Now, you can click on the anchor button to jump to the anchored verse. You can also right-click on the anchor button for 
other options, like adding a comment to the anchor (e.g. "implied by ..."). These comments will be displayed when you hover 
the mouse over an anchor button. You can also add a cultural or exegetical note about the anchor by right-clicking on the 
anchor button and choosing "Add Exegetical/Cultural Note". Such notes can help the consultant understand why you chose the 
Bible reference that you did.

In the Bible pane in the lower left, by default the NetBible version of the Bible will be displayed. In the upper portion 
of that pane, there are several small "radio buttons" with labels like "NETfree" (which refers to the NetBible) and "Other". 
Click on the "Other" button to view different Bible text resources that may be installed on your computer, such as a Hindi 
Bible translation or an Easy English version of the Bible. Talk with your workshop advisor for other options available.

Remember that each verse must have at least one anchor. 

When you are finished adding anchors for each verse, then click the button in the left-hand side of the status bar and 
choose 'Next Stage' to go to the next stage in the process.

    <StageDisplayString>Crafter adds story testing questions</StageDisplayString>
    <StageInstructions>
In this stage, one of the crafting team will go through the story and add "Story Testing Questions" (STQs). These are 
questions that you will eventually ask an uninitiated native speaker (UNS) in order to test the implications of the story.

The best kind of STQ are those that invite the UNS to speculate on "Why" or "How" of what is going on in the story. Or
questions that ask, "What kinds of things might be an example of this?" are also useful. They should be based on the 
story, but you should try to get the UNS to speculate beyond what the story itself says. For example, suppose that the
story had a verse like, "And the people took baptism and left their sins". You could ask a question like, "Why
(or how) do you think they took baptism?" or "How (or why) do you think they left their sins?" These would be good 
questions, because the answer isn't in the story and based on what the UNS thinks, it might be necessary to revise the 
story to avoid a wrong understanding. 

Other kinds of questions that begin with "What", "Who", "When", "Where", are usually not as good, especially if they can 
be answered from the story itself. For example, suppose the story verse says, "Jesus and three of his disciples went up 
on a hill..." Then the question, "How many disciples went up on the hill with Jesus?" would not be a good question, 
because the answer was just mentioned in the story. Such questions are known as "closed questions" and are not good 
questions to test the story.

Also, story testing questions shouldn’t be questions for which the answer is either "yes" or "no". For example, a
question like, "Did Joseph reveal himself to his brothers before they left?" Also, questions about what something means 
are not good questions. For example, "What does the phrase "sabt din" mean?". These are examples of questions that are 
not good story testing questions.

Also, they also shouldn’t be questions which ask the UNS for their personal beliefs or theological opinion (e.g. "Do you 
think that God could really have created the world in 6 days?") or questions which can't really help the story regardless 
of the answer (e.g. "In your opinion can a person stay in a cattle shed?"). Besides being a "yes-no" question, this one 
can't possibly help correct any misinterpretation from the story, regardless of what answer is given.

When you think of questions to ask, keep in mind what kind of answer you might get from the UNS. If the answer could show 
that they misunderstood the situation in the story, then it's probably a good question.

Depending on what agreement you make with your consultant and coach, you may need to translate the testing questions you 
create into English so the consultant and coach can review them. However, remember that these questions should always be 
asked and answered with the UNS in the story language itself; not the national language, nor in English. 

You should have at least half as many story testing questions as verses in the story. So if your story is 20 verses long, 
then you need to have at least 10 questions, and don't forget that it's okay if some verses have multiple questions.

When you are finished adding these testing questions, then click the button in the left-hand side of the status bar and 
choose 'Next Stage' to go to the next stage in the process.

    <StageDisplayString>Consultant checks the story anchors</StageDisplayString>
    <StageInstructions>
In this stage, you (the consultant) need to check the anchors added by the crafter(s) for each verse of the story.

The anchors shown in the Story pane are actually buttons, which if you click, will jump to the passage in the 
Bible pane. You need to make sure that all the information in the story verse is covered by the anchored 
passage(s). If the story verse has information which is not in the anchored passages, it's okay for you to add 
further anchors if you can think of a scripture passage which supports what the story crafter is trying say (or 
add a consultant note for the crafter to look up the passage and add the anchor themself).

As you evaluate whether the story verse is a valid interpretation of the anchored verses, in addition to the 
text in the Bible pane, it is recommended that you look in Translator's Workplace exegetical resources. If you 
find a passage in a good exegetical resource that supports the rendering of the story crafter (when, perhaps, 
the scripture passage in the Bible pane doesn't seem to support it), then you can copy the reference from TW 
and paste it into an exegetical comment line (right-click on an anchor button in the Story pane and choose 
"Add cultural/exegetical note" and paste the comment from TW).

As you look up passages in the Bible pane, you can right-click on the book name box to shift to other books 
in the Bible or click the up/down arrows to shift to the next/previous verse, chapter or book.

When you are finished adding these testing questions, then click the button in the left-hand side of the

    <StageInstructions>
In this stage, you (the consultant) need to check the story testing questions added by the crafter(s).

As you consider the story testing questions (STQs), keep in mind that their function is to test the 
implications of the story. The best kind of STQ are those that invite the UNS to speculate on "Why" 
or "How" of what is going on in the story. Or questions that ask, "What kinds of things might be an 
example of this?" are also useful. They should be based on the story, but you should try to get the 
UNS to speculate beyond what the story itself says. For example, suppose that the story had a verse 
like, "And the people took baptism and left their sins". A good question would be like, "Why (or how) 
do you think they took baptism?" or "How (or why) do you think they left their sins?" These would be 
good questions, because the answer isn't in the story and based on what answer the UNS gives, it 
might indicate that the story is giving a wrong understanding.

Less useful are content-questions that begin with "What", "Who", "When", "Where", which can usually 
be answered from the story itself (e.g. for a story verse like, "Jesus and three of his disciples 
went up on a hill..." Then it wouldn't be as useful to ask questions like, "How many disciples went 
up on the hill with Jesus?" or "Where did Jesus go?" Such questions are known as "closed questions" 
and are not good for testing the story.

Also, story testing questions shouldn’t be "yes-no" questions (questions for which the answer is either 
"yes" or "no"). For example, a question like, "Did Joseph reveal himself to his brothers before they 
left?" Also, questions about what something means are not good questions. For example, "What does the 
phrase "sabt din" mean?". These are examples of questions that are not good story testing questions.

Also, they also shouldn’t be questions which ask the UNS for their personal beliefs or theological 
opinion (e.g. "Do you think that God could really have created the world in 6 days?").

Finally, as you evaluate a question always be thinking about what kind of answer a UNS might give. If
the answer can't really help the story regardless of what the answer is, then it is not a good question.
For example, a question like, "In your opinion can a person stay in a cattle shed?". Besides being a 
"yes-no" question, this one can't possibly help correct any misinterpretation from the story, regardless 
of what answer the UNS gives.

If you feel that any particular question is not a good question, then add a note to the Consultant Note
pane for that line recommending that the Crafting team make a change to the question. It is important
to indicate why the question is not a good one so that they can learn what our goal is in asking the
questions.

When you are finished adding these testing questions, then click the button in the left-hand side of 
the status bar and choose 'Next Stage' to go to the next stage in the process. In the next state, the
Coach will evaluate your feedback and possibly put comments in the Coach Notes pane, which you will 
respond to before your feedback goes back to the Crafting team. If you have a question about your 
feedback, you can show the Coach Notes pane ("View" menu, "Coach notes field") and right-click on the
small button to the right-hand side of the appropriate line number and choose "Add Note".
