								 NOTE

The form in which the Bible is given here is not simply another
example of the Bible story put into present-day English. The language
used is Basic English. /1

		Basic English, produced by Mr C. K. Ogden of the Orthological
Institute, is a simple form of the English language which, with 850
words, /2 is able to give the sense of anything which may be said in
English.

		Working with the Orthological Institute, a Committee under the
direction of Professor S. H. Hooke, Professor Emeritus of Old
Testament Studies in the University of London, has been responsible
for a new English form of the Bible made from the Hebrew and the
Greek.

		In this undertaking, the latest ideas and discoveries in
connection with the work of putting the Bible into other languages
were taken into account, and when the Basic form was complete it was
gone over in detail by a Committee formed by the Syndics of the
Cambridge University Press.

		The Basic Bible, which in this way was watched over by two
separate groups of experts through its different stages, is designed
to be used wherever the English language has taken root.

		Frequently, the narrow limits of the word-list make it hard to
keep the Basic completely parallel with the Hebrew and the Greek; but
great trouble has been taken with every verse and every line to make
certain that there are no errors of sense and no loose wording. It is
only natural that, from time to time, some of the more delicate shades
of sense have not been covered; on the other hand, it is well to keep
in mind that in the Authorised Version the power and music of the
language sometimes take so much of the reader's attention that these
more delicate shades are overlooked.

		In fact, the Basic expert is forced, because of the limited
material with which he is working, to give special care to the sense
of the words before him. There is no question of the Basic work taking
the place of the Authorised Version or coming into competition with
it; but it may be said of this new English Bible that it is in a
marked degree straightforward and simple and that these qualities give
it an independent value.

/1 The language of this _Note_.
/2 By the addition of 50 Special Bible words and the use of 100 words
   listed as giving most help in the reading of English verse, this
   number has been increased to 1000 for the purpose of putting the
   Bible into Basic.

					   SIGNS USED IN THIS BOOK

...  are used where it is no longer possible to be certain of the true
	 sense of the Hebrew words, and for this reason no attempt has
	 been made to put them into Basic.

***  are used as a sign that one or more Hebrew words, necessary to
	 the sense, have been taken out at some time or other.

[]   are used for marking additions made by later writers.

( )  are used for marking additions put in for the purpose of making
	 the sense clear.

< >  have been put round the numbers of verses which have been moved
	 to a different position from that which they have in the
	 Authorised and Revised Versions.
	 [Ed. etext version does not retain this "creative" and
	 spurious arrangement. Verses marked with <> have been
	 restored to their standard and original location as they
	 appear in source documents.]

Sloping print:  When words are used which are not in the Basic list,
they are printed in sloping print the first time they are used in any
division of any book.
[Ed. etext version does not maintain this distinction as the printed
version did not follow this method regularly.]

The numbers used for divisions of books and for verses are the same as
in the Authorised and Revised Versions of the English Bible.
