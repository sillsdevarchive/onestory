ConNotes window, rightclick on the number.
\bt backtranslation (keep your lines fairly short)
\bt to JUMP: From this line you can jump to records you have made in the
keyterms database. For example, if this line had the word "God" in it, and
if you have made a keyterm record called "God", then a rightclick on the
word "God" will immediately bring up the record in the keyterms
database.
\anc anchor ref -- If you are working with a language for which there is translated scripture with a
backtraslation, it would be helpful to your consultant for you to paste the BT of the
appropriate vss.

cursor will immediately bring up the verse in the Netbible window
\cn Crafting note -- put cultural info here, or reasons why you crafted the story in a certain way,
or information about this line from your testing groups.
\cn to JUMP: From this line you can also reference records you have made of Cultural
observations. For example, if this line of the story is about the Wedding at Cana, and you
have made observations about weddings in the group you work with, A rightclick on the word
Wedding will jump to the "Wedding" record in the Cultural notes database. (Note that in order
for the jump to work, the Cultural Notes database needs to be sorted by \r)
\tst testing question -- prepare testing questions ahead of time.  Then put the response here also.
\old A preivous version of this line of this line of the story.  As you proceed through testing and
editing of the story you occasionally decide to delete a line or to make major changes. If you
do that, we'd like for you to keep old versions of each line--especially if there have been
consultant comments about it.
