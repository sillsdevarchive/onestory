			<MAP mn="1">                    // @mn = number of words/phrase (in TU/@k)
			  <TU f="0" k="Δ">              // @f = forcing (something in the AI UI; not sure)
											// @k = source word 'key'
				<RS n="1" a="ασδγδ" />      // @n = number of occurrences of this adaptation
											// @a = target word 'adaptation'
			  </TU>
			</MAP>
		  </KB>
		 *
		 * V6.0.0 of AI adds these new attributes to the RS element:
		 *  @df = DeleteFlag (indicates whether the adaptation was deleted)
		 *  @cDT = time/date stamp of the creation of this adaptation
		 *  @mDT = time/date stamp of the last modification of this adaptation
		 *  @dDT = time/date stamp of the deletion of this adaptation
		 *  @wC = stands for 'who created' and gives a username/computer mapping for
		 *          the creator/last modifier
		 * However, we don't care about any of these (except TU/@k = source word
		 * and RS/@a = target word (and I guess MAP/mn, which AI seems to need to
		 * be sorted in order of increasing value of 'mn'.
		 * Doing the sorting in the MergeStrategies, however, is very costly, so
		 * we'll pretend that the order doesn't matter and then just before saving
		 * the result, we do an xslt sort (which is very efficient).
		 * Also, we will explicitly ask the MergeStrategies to ignore all of these
		 * other superflueous attributes or we get lots of conflicts for very (well
		 * zero) return on investment.
